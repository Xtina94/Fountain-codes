\subsubsection{BER bounds on UEP fountain codes}
Another interesting point of view is the one given in \cite{Yue2014}, where the main aim is not optimizing the general success probability, but instead defining an upper and lower \gls{ber} bound in the case of \gls{uep} for \gls{dnc} schemes over Rayleigh fading channels.

Distributed coding is an efficient channel coding strategy that improves the transmission reliability of cooperative communication networks. In many real-life applications, source nodes require a form of unequal protection from errors, instead of the Equal counterpart, and this is as the origin of the design of a form of fountain codes called \gls{UEP} fountain codes. In \cite{Yue2014}, the authors adopt the wieghted method to realize such codes, which consists in dividing the transmission data into several protection groups according to their protection requirements and assigning corresponding protection weights.
