\section{Conclusions}
The brief state of the art presented with this work highlights the main achievements accomplished so far in the field of digital fountain codes, and in particular in the cases of LT- and Raptor codes. The results that emerge from the works analyzed clearly emphasize the improvements that these approaches can bring to a vast set of problems, from \gls{dnc} to \gls{wsn} in terms of decoding success probability, \gls{ber}, overhead shortening and so decoding time and efficiency, while at the same time there is still much space for further insights and improvements.
